# Wind Chill Calculator

This program is cool I think, it calculates the wind chill based on the current fahrenheit temperature and wind speed in miles per hour. Even though you can probably just google search this I think my program is cooler so you should use this instead. Don't worry, it doesn't suck ass anymore.
